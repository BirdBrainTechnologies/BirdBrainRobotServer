BirdBrainSnap
================

Snap! is a drag and drop programming environment developed by Jens MÃ¶nig and Brian Harvey. Snap! is a descendant of Scratch and adds a number of key features like creating custom blocks, recursion, and running in a browser.

We have developed a utility, the BirdBrain Robot Server, that allows Finch and Hummingbird to be controlled from within Snap!.
